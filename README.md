## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to dive deeper into native CSS math functions. My goal is to become highly comfortable using functions like calc(), clamp(), min(), and max().

I want to transition away from relying entirely on fixed values and rigid media queries, and instead use these functions to create truly fluid, automated, and scalable layouts.
